# Operations Research (OR)

## üìå Overview  
Operations Research (OR) is a discipline that applies advanced analytical methods to help make better decisions. It uses mathematical modeling, statistical analysis, and optimization techniques to solve complex problems in business, engineering, healthcare, logistics, and more.

OR combines tools from:  
- Mathematics  
- Computer Science  
- Economics  
- Engineering  
- Statistics  

The goal is to determine the best possible course of action (optimization) given limited resources and constraints.

## üîç Key Concepts  

### 1. Optimization Problems  
Finding the maximum or minimum of an objective function under given constraints:  
- **Linear Programming (LP)**: Problems with linear objectives and constraints  
- **Integer Programming**: Where variables must take integer values  
- **Nonlinear Programming**: For nonlinear objectives/constraints  

### 2. Decision Analysis  
Structured approach to making decisions under uncertainty using:  
- Decision trees  
- Utility theory  
- Risk analysis  

### 3. Stochastic Models  
For problems involving randomness/probability:  
- Queueing theory  
- Markov decision processes  
- Simulation modeling  

### 4. Network Models  
For interconnected systems:  
- Shortest path problems  
- Minimum spanning trees  
- Max flow problems  
- Transportation/assignment problems  

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Tools & Techniques  

- **Simplex Method** (for LP problems)  
- **Branch and Bound** (for integer programming)  
- **Dynamic Programming**  
- **Genetic Algorithms**  
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**  
- **Game Theory** applications
